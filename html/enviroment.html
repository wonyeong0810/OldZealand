                <p>The DMZ is an important wintering ground for the globally endangered crane. Of the 15 species of cranes in the world, seven are found in South Korea, with the most common species of cranes found along the DMZ being the whooping crane and the red-crowned crane. </p>

                <p>The Long-tailed Goral, a Natural Monument No. 217 and a Class I endangered wildlife species, lives in the rocky mountains around the DMZ. They are often referred to as ‘living fossils’ because they look much the same now as they did when they were first discovered on Earth. You can also see them at the Deer Ecological Park, a national ecological park.</p>

                <p>The mountainous eastern part of the DMZ, where it meets the Paektu River, is the closest thing to primeval forest in the DMZ. It remains a natural forest and is home to rare flora and fauna. The endangered musk deer has been found in the eastern mountains of the DMZ. It is a member of the deer family and is characterised by its lack of antlers and long tusks on its upper jaw that protrude out of its mouth.</p>

                <h1>Otter</h1>
                <p>Otters are free-ranging animals that live in rivers that run through North and South Korea, making them a symbolic mammal of peaceful exchanges between the two countries. Today, their numbers are plummeting due to habitat destruction. Otters have wide webbing on their front and back feet, making them excellent swimmers, often referred to as leopards of the water.</p>
