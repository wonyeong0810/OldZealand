                <p>The Hantan River is a river that flows through a volcanic region in the central-western part of the Korean Peninsula. It originates in Pyeonggang-gun, Gangwon-do, flows through Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do, and joins the Imjin River between Jeongok-eup and Misan-myeon, Yeoncheon-gun.</p>

                <p>The DMZ was left in ruins after the war, but over time, nature has restored it, transforming it into a 248-kilometre east-west ecological axis that has become the core ecological axis of the Korean Peninsula. The Chuguryeong Gorge, Jusangjuli, and Red Wall along the Hantan and Imjin rivers, which bisect the Korean Peninsula, are not only a testament to the geological history of the Korean Peninsula, but are also scenic and valuable as tourist resources.</p>

                <p>Located in the Hantan River UNESCO World Geopark, the Chulwontan River Jusangjuli Trail is 3.6 kilometres long and 1.5 metres wide, and is a ‘path of feeling!’ that takes you along the cliffs, through the colourful rock-filled Sundam Valley and along the cliffs and hollow rocks of the representative Jusangjuli Gorge of the Hantan River, offering both thrilling and beautiful scenery.</p>
