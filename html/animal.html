                <h1>Elk</h1>
                <p>The elk is an endangered species, but there are a number of individuals living in South Korea, especially in the DMZ.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="title">
                <p>The DMZ is home to a variety of important natural ecological areas, including vegetation areas, wetlands, habitats for rare plant species, and natural scenic areas, and is home to more than 2,930 species of higher plants and vertebrates. This represents 30 per cent of the flora and fauna on the Korean Peninsula and includes 44 endangered species in need of protection, including cranes, flying squirrels, otters and mountain goats.</p>

                <h1>Flying squirrel</h1>
                <p>It has a well-developed nasal membrane between the front and hind paws. Its back is pale grey with brown patches. The belly is white and the area around the eyes is blackish-brown. Sky squirrels live in natural forests in mountainous areas of the country, some of which are more than 20 years old. They're small, nocturnal, and can usually travel 20-30 metres, sometimes more than 100 metres, in a single glide. They live in tree cavities repaired by woodpeckers or in man-made birdhouses. They eat a plant-based diet of bark, leaves, snow, seeds, fruit, and mushrooms.</p>

                <p>The DMZ is an important wintering ground for the globally endangered crane. 
                    Of the 15 species of cranes in the world, 
                    seven are found in South Korea, with the most common species of 
                    cranes found along the DMZ being the whooping crane and the red-crowned crane. </p>

                <p>The Long-tailed Goral, a Natural Monument No. 217 and a Class I endangered wildlife species, 
                    lives in the rocky mountains around the DMZ. They are often referred to as ‘living fossils’ because 
                    they look much the same now as they did when they were first discovered on Earth. You can also see them at the 
                    Deer Ecological Park, a national ecological park.</p>

                <p>The mountainous eastern part of the DMZ, where it meets the Paektu River,
                     is the closest thing to primeval forest in the DMZ. It remains a natural forest 
                     and is home to rare flora and fauna. The endangered musk deer has been found in the eastern mountains of the DMZ. 
                     It is a member of the deer family and is characterised by its 
                     lack of antlers and long tusks on its upper jaw that protrude out of its mouth.</p>

                    and we can imagine the future of the DMZ where humans and nature coexist.</p>

                <h1>Otter</h1>
                <p>Otters are free-ranging animals that live in rivers that run through North and South Korea, 
                    making them a symbolic mammal of peaceful exchanges between the two countries. 
                    Today, their numbers are plummeting due to habitat destruction. Otters have wide webbing
                     on their front and back feet, making them excellent swimmers, often referred to as leopards of the water.</p>
