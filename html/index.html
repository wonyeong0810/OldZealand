        <p class="ex">
          concept of dmz<br>
          DMZ stands for “demilitarized zone” and refers to a military demilitarized zone. <br>
          The DMZ is a buffer zone that is set at a certain distance from each other to prevent <br>
          direct military conflict following an armistice. <br>
          The DMZ on the Korean Peninsula was established by the Armistice Agreement of the Korean War, <br>
          which took place from 1950 to 1953. <br>
          The agreement established a military demarcation line and stated <br>
          that both sides would retreat two kilometers from this line to establish a demilitarized <br>
          zone to prevent a recurrence of hostilities. As such, the DMZ prohibits <br>
          the stationing of troops, the deployment of weapons, <br>
          and the installation of military facilities. The DMZ is <br>
          also a measure under international law that legally declares an area <br>
          to be demilitarized, and a body was created to monitor it. Politically and militarily, <br>
          it is recognized as an arms control measure to stop combat <br>
          activity and maintain a temporary peace. In summary, a DMZ consists of four main elements: demilitarization, <br>
          the existence of a buffer zone, the separation of military forces or the isolated deployment of troops, <br>
          and the establishment of a monitoring body. <br>
          <br>
          Scope of the DMZ<br>
          The DMZ in South Korea is a 248-kilometer-long military demarcation line <br>
          from the mouth of the Imjin River on the west coast to Goseong in Gangwon Province on the east coast, <br>
          with two kilometers of space on each side of the line and a total of four kilometers between the two sides. <br>
          The total area of the DMZ is 907 square kilometers, or 1/250 of the total area of the Korean Peninsula.<br>
          (The original agreement was for a 2-kilometer buffer, but North Korea added 2 kilometers, <br>
          making it 4 kilometers.) Although the DMZ is a military buffer zone, there is still a risk of military conflict, <br>
          so a civilian control line has been established. This control line <br>
          is between 5 and 20 kilometers south of the Demilitarized Zone, covering a total area of 1,528 square kilometers. <br>
          In this area, civilian residences and industrial activities are restricted and unauthorized entry is prohibited. <br>
          Therefore, it is reasonable to understand the DMZ as the entire buffer zone of 30 to 40 kilometers, <br>
          including the civilian control line, since access and development to adjacent areas have been <br>
          strongly controlled for military purposes.

        <h1 class="title">SIGNIFICANCE : WHY DMZ?</h1>
        <p>VALUE of the DMZ<br>
          Due to the establishment of the DMZ and the restriction and control of civilian access, natural ecosystems have been reestablished in the area north of the DMZ and the Civilian Demarcation Line, which have been untouched by humans for the past 50 years, and have been able to retain valuable ecological resources. As a result, the border area is highly regarded as an area of high ecological value, being called a treasure trove of natural ecosystems not only in Korea but also globally. In addition to its ecological value, the DMZ has become an area of global interest due to its security value as the world's only symbol of division, and in light of the coming era of inter-Korean exchange and cooperation, as well as the era of national reunification, the area is emerging as a land of opportunity that can be utilized as a base for advancing inter-Korean reunification, a treasure trove of ecological resources, and a place for tourism and history education.
