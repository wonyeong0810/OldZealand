        <h1 class="title">ABOUT DMZ</h1>
        <p class="ex">
          concept of dmz<br>
          DMZ stands for “demilitarized zone” and refers to a military demilitarized zone. <br>
          The DMZ is a buffer zone that is set at a certain distance from each other to prevent <br>
          direct military conflict following an armistice. <br>
          The DMZ on the Korean Peninsula was established by the Armistice Agreement of the Korean War, <br>
          which took place from 1950 to 1953. <br>
          The agreement established a military demarcation line and stated <br>
          that both sides would retreat two kilometers from this line to establish a demilitarized <br>
          zone to prevent a recurrence of hostilities. As such, the DMZ prohibits <br>
          the stationing of troops, the deployment of weapons, <br>
          and the installation of military facilities. The DMZ is <br>
          also a measure under international law that legally declares an area <br>
          to be demilitarized, and a body was created to monitor it. Politically and militarily, <br>
          it is recognized as an arms control measure to stop combat <br>
          activity and maintain a temporary peace. In summary, a DMZ consists of four main elements: demilitarization, <br>
          the existence of a buffer zone, the separation of military forces or the isolated deployment of troops, <br>
          and the establishment of a monitoring body. <br>
          <br>
          Scope of the DMZ<br>
          The DMZ in South Korea is a 248-kilometer-long military demarcation line <br>
          from the mouth of the Imjin River on the west coast to Goseong in Gangwon Province on the east coast, <br>
          with two kilometers of space on each side of the line and a total of four kilometers between the two sides. <br>
          The total area of the DMZ is 907 square kilometers, or 1/250 of the total area of the Korean Peninsula.<br>
          (The original agreement was for a 2-kilometer buffer, but North Korea added 2 kilometers, <br>
          making it 4 kilometers.) Although the DMZ is a military buffer zone, there is still a risk of military conflict, <br>
          so a civilian control line has been established. This control line <br>
          is between 5 and 20 kilometers south of the Demilitarized Zone, covering a total area of 1,528 square kilometers. <br>
          In this area, civilian residences and industrial activities are restricted and unauthorized entry is prohibited. <br>
          Therefore, it is reasonable to understand the DMZ as the entire buffer zone of 30 to 40 kilometers, <br>
          including the civilian control line, since access and development to adjacent areas have been <br>
          strongly controlled for military purposes.

        <h1 class="title">SIGNIFICANCE : WHY DMZ?</h1>
        <p class="ex">VALUE of the DMZ<br>
          Due to the establishment of the DMZ and the restriction and control of civilian access, <br>
          natural ecosystems have been reestablished in the area north of the DMZ and the Civilian Demarcation Line, <br>
          which have been untouched by humans for the past 50 years, <br>
          and have been able to retain valuable ecological resources. <br>
          As a result, the border area is highly regarded as an area of high ecological value, being called a treasure <br>
          trove of natural ecosystems not only in Korea but also globally. In addition to its ecological value, <br>
          the DMZ has become an area of global interest due to its security value as the world's only symbol of division, <br>
          and in light of the coming era of inter-Korean exchange and cooperation, <br>
          as well as the era of national reunification, the area is emerging as a land of opportunity <br>
          that can be utilized as a base for advancing inter-Korean reunification, <br>
          a treasure trove of ecological resources, and a place for tourism and history education.<br>
          <br>
          HISTORY of the DMZ<br>
          North Korea launched the Korean War on June 25, 1950, and the war ended on July 27, <br>
          1953, with an armistice agreement between the United Nations, North Korea, and China.<br>
          between the United Nations and North Korea and China on July 27, 1953, <br>
          led to a ceasefire and the formation of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea. <br>
          Since the 1960s, the DMZ has become a heavily militarized zone, with North Korea continuing to carry out armed <br>
          provocations in the DMZ, including the 1976 Axe Massacre and the 1993 attempt to neutralize the Neutrality Commission.<br> 
          However, efforts to promote peaceful use of the DMZ have continued. <br>
          Examples include the first proposal for peaceful use of the DMZ in 1971, <br>
          President Roh Tae-woo's proposal to build a peace city in 1988, the signing of the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement in 1991, <br>
          the start of tourism to Mount Kumgang in 1998, the connection of the Gyeongui Line and Donghae Line railways in 2000, <br>
          and the first production of goods in the Kaesong Industrial Complex in 2004. <br>
          As such, the DMZ, a place that symbolizes the history of the division, <br>
          is increasingly recognized as a treasure trove of ecosystems and a place <br>
          that is shaping a new phase of inter-Korean relations and world peace.<br>
          The DMZ is a place where the history of the Korean Peninsula is alive, <br>
          an important symbolic area for peace and reunification, and a living ecosystem.
